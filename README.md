## Introduction

In a society where medical records are unevenly distributed, uncertainty in diagnosis and treatment often arises as doctors rely solely on patient complaints during examinations. Shockingly, as of 2021, approximately 50% of Indonesia's population—around 169 million people—lack medical records, as reported by the Ministry of Health. Compounding this issue, long queues at health centers create inefficiencies in service delivery. In 2023, only about 40% of Indonesian health centers have implemented effective queuing systems, be it online or offline, posing logistical and management challenges in providing adequate services to the public. A comprehensive solution is needed to enhance efficiency and service quality in health centers.
